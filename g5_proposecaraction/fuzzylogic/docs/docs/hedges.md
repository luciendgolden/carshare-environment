Module fuzzylogic.hedges
========================
Lingual hedges modify curves of membership values.

These should work with Sets and functions.

Functions
---------

    
`minus(g)`
:   Increase membership support so that more values hit the top.

    
`plus(g)`
:   Sharpen memberships like 'very' but not as strongly.

    
`very(g)`
:   Sharpen memberships so that only the values close 1 stay at the top.
